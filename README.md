# Spellbook

Spellbook is a local-first **macOS app** built with SwiftUI for managing spellbooks and spells. This repo currently contains the project scaffold and a minimal UI skeleton so we can build features in slices.

## Getting Started

1. Open `Spellbook.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
2. Select **My Mac** as the run destination.
3. Click **Run**.
